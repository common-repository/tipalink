Adds the Tipalink App to your WordPress website.

== Description ==

This plugin activates the Tipalink App on your site by adding a JavaScript script and a meta tag to the head section.

Tipalink is a service that lets website visitors tip web pages by their address or "link".

After installation, the Tipalink App will be loaded in the background on the front-end of your site.

The Tipalink App can be opened by clicking on any HTML element on the page that includes the class name "tipalink-tip".

There is an option in the plugin settings titled "Global Button". If set to "Yes", then a small button is added to the lower right hand corner of the site which opens the Tipalink App.
